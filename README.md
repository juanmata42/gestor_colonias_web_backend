Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Docker
Docker Compose
Docker Compose comes installed with Docker Desktop for Windows and Mac, but you may need to install it separately on Linux.

Installation
Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-directory
Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of your project directory. Adjust the following template based on your application's specific environment variables:

env
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@pg:5432/postgres
Replace the values as necessary for your configuration.

Build and Run with Docker Compose

From the root of your project directory, run the following command to build and start your application:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This command builds the Docker images for your application and starts the containers as defined in your docker-compose.yml file.

Accessing the Application
After successfully starting the application, you can access it at:

http://localhost:5000 (Replace 5000 with the actual port you configured for your application service.)
Stopping the Application
To stop your application, use the following command in the terminal where your application is running:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
This command stops and removes the containers created by docker-compose up. To also remove the volumes and images, you can use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all
Additional Commands
Viewing Logs

To view the logs of your running containers, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs
Rebuilding the Application

If you make changes to your application, rebuild your Docker containers with:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with port conflicts, ensure no other services are running on the same ports configured for your application and database.
Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are correctly installed and running on your system.
